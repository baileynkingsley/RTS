# RTS

These are my solutions for the RTS Lab Code Exercise. RTS1.java corresponds to exercise #1, and RTS2.java corresponds to exercise #2.

#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

I think SQL is my favorite language. I'd like the ability to use the FROM clause before the SELECT clause. It makes more sense to me to start with the table and then narrow it down to the columns.
